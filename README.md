<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation
### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)** (Latest stable version)
- **[Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)** (Included with Flutter)
- **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)** (For Android development)
- **[Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/sdk-tools)** (Installed via Android Studio)
- **[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (Optional but recommended for Flutter development)
- **Device Emulator** (or a physical device with USB debugging enabled)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd your-project-folder
```
3. Open the code in visual studio code:
```
code .
```
4. Run this to download all dependencies listed on ```pubspec.yaml```:
```
flutter pub get
```
<br>
Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:

5. **`.env` File**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following line:
   ```
   ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-access-token>
   ```
   Replace ```<your-access-token>``` with your actual Mapbox access token.

6. ```nodes.geojson``` File: <br>
Ensure you have a ```nodes.geojson``` file in your project directory. This file should contain your dataset from Mapbox in ```GeoJSON format```.



#### Optional

1. Add the following code to your shell configuration file (e.g., ```~/.bashrc```, ```~/.zshrc```, etc.):
```
runflutter() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: runflutter <device-name>"
        return 1
    fi
    flutter run -d "$1" | grep -v -e 'updateAcquireFence' -e 'err open mi_exception_log' -e 'err write to mi_exception_log' -e 'QueueBuffer time out'
}
```
2. Save the file and reload your shell configuration:
```
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```
3. The ```runflutter``` command in your terminal will later be used in running the application.

<!-- PHONE SETUP -->
### Phone Setup

If you're going to use an **emulator** instead of a physical phone to run the app, you can **skip** this section. However, if you want to use a **physical phone**, follow the steps below to configure your device.

#### Step 1: Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging
1. Watch this video to learn how to enable **Developer Options** on your phone:  
   [How to Enable Developer Options on Android](https://youtu.be/zu9oCE9N8H0?si=aNqJr9S2lwZdXRNF).
2. Once Developer Options is enabled, locate **USB Debugging** and turn it on.
3. Near the USB Debugging option, find **Wireless Debugging** and turn it on as well.

#### Step 2: Pair Your Device with Your Laptop/PC
To pair your device with your development machine:
1. Open **Android Studio**.
2. Click the **Wi-Fi icon** (or go to the **Device Manager**) to view available connections.
3. Pair your device using one of the following methods:
   - **QR Code**: Click "Pair using QR Code" on your phone and scan the QR code displayed in Android Studio.
   - **Pairing Code**: Click "Pair using Pairing Code" and enter the code displayed on your phone.

#### Step 3: Verify Connection
- Once paired, your phone will show a notification confirming it is connected to **Wireless Debugging**.
- If the connection is successful, you can proceed to the next steps in your development workflow.

---

**Note**: Ensure your phone and laptop/PC are on the same Wi-Fi network for Wireless Debugging to work properly.
   
<!-- HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM -->
##  Run

### Step 1: List Connected Devices
To get a list of all connected devices, run the following command in your terminal:
```
flutter devices
```
An output like this will appear:
```
Found 3 connected devices:
  Windows (desktop) ‚Ä¢ windows ‚Ä¢ windows-x64    ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100.2894]
  Chrome (web)      ‚Ä¢ chrome  ‚Ä¢ web-javascript ‚Ä¢ Google Chrome 132.0.6834.160
  Edge (web)        ‚Ä¢ edge    ‚Ä¢ web-javascript ‚Ä¢ Microsoft Edge 132.0.2957.127

Found 1 wirelessly connected device:
  M2101K6G (mobile) ‚Ä¢ adb-de63fc98-IyvXZg._adb-tls-connect._tcp ‚Ä¢ android-arm64 ‚Ä¢ Android 13 (API 33)
```
Copy the phone ID (e.g., ```adb-de63fc98-IyvXZg._adb-tls-connect._tcp```) from the output.

### Step 2: Run the App
There are three ways to run the app:

#### Option 1: Automated Process (Recommended)
If you‚Äôve automated the process using the ```runflutter``` function, simply type:
```
runflutter <phone-id>
```
Example: 
```
runflutter adb-de63fc98-IyvXZg._adb-tls-connect._tcp
```

#### Option 2: Manual Process
If you didn‚Äôt set up the automation, use the following command:
```
flutter run -d <phone-id> | grep -v -e 'updateAcquireFence' -e 'err open mi_exception_log' -e 'err write to mi_exception_log' -e 'QueueBuffer time out'
```

#### Option 3: Using an Emulator
If you‚Äôre using an emulator:
1. Open the cloned project in **Android Studio**.
2. Set up and start an emulator from the **Device Manager**.
3. Click the **Run** button in Android Studio to launch the app on the emulator.

### Step 3: Wait for the App to Run
Once you‚Äôve entered the command or clicked the Run button in Android Studio, wait for the app to build and launch on your device or emulator.
